# Artefact Revenue Intelligence MCP Server

> A methodology-driven MCP server for B2B revenue intelligence. Provides RFM analysis, 14.5-point ICP qualification, and pipeline health scoring through Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible AI tools. Integrates with HubSpot CRM.

Artefact MCP Server is different from generic HubSpot CRUD wrappers because it embeds the Artefact Formula — battle-tested scoring models, segmentation logic, and qualification frameworks built from real B2B consulting engagements with companies between $1.6M-$70M revenue.

## Core Tools

- [RFM Analysis](https://github.com/alexboissAV/artefact-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md#run_rfm--rfm-analysis): Scores clients on Recency, Frequency, Monetary value. Segments into 11 categories (Champions through Lost). Extracts ICP patterns from top performers. Supports B2B service, SaaS, and manufacturing presets.
- [ICP Qualification](https://github.com/alexboissAV/artefact-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md#qualify--icp-qualification-145-point-model): 14.5-point scoring model across Firmographic Fit (5pts), Behavioral Fit (5pts), Strategic Fit (4.5pts). Returns 4-tier classification (Ideal/Strong/Moderate/Poor) with engagement strategy.
- [Pipeline Health Score](https://github.com/alexboissAV/artefact-mcp-server/blob/main/README.md#score_pipeline_health--pipeline-health-score): 0-100 health score analyzing velocity metrics, stage conversion rates, bottleneck identification, and at-risk deal detection.
